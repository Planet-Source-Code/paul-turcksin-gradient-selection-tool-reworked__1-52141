## Gradient selection tool \(Reworked\)


</div>

### Description

:The tool submitted by Edwin Perez helps you test different color combinations that you can use anywhere you need a

background with gradient.The dificulty with the GradientFill API is that it uses unsigned integers (unsupportrd by VB) for the color definition. I

believe I found a way to resolve this problem using the RtlMoveMemory API. This solution is simple and easy to understand/implement.More

details in Readme file. I also tried to streamline/optimise the code by using arrays, so there is not much left from the original code. There's no need for votes.
